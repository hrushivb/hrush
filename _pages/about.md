I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Florida, under the supervision of [Dr. Sara Rampazzi](https://sararampazzi.com/). I work in sensor and cyber-physical systems security. I am part of [CPSec Lab](https://sararampazzi.com/CPSecLab.html) and [FICS Research](https://fics.institute.ufl.edu/).

My primary research is in securing sensors and cyber-physical systems, with particular emphasis on autonomous systems. As part of my research, I uncover and study new vulnerabilities in sensors used in autonomous systems and the downstream signal processing and machine learning pipelines. I build effective countermeasures against these vulnerabilities using physical invariability in sensor characteristics, contextual information, and machine learning techniques. Using my research, I aim to contribute to more robust cyber-physical and autonomous systems, ensuring the safety of the people who use them and increasing their trust in these technologies.
