Education
======
* Ph.D in Computer Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 2025 (expected)
* M.S. in Computer Information Science and Engineering, University of Florida, 2021
* B.S. in Electronics and Computer Engineering, JNTU, 2019

Research experience
======
* **Cyber-Physical Systems Security (CPSec) Lab, University of Florida (Jan 2021 - Present)**
  * Discovered and analyzed vulnerabilities in perception sensors, autonomous system signal processing pipelines, and their implications on downstream tasks.
  * Studied and evaluated new physical world vulnerabilities in traffic sign and traffic light recognition systems used in autonomous vehicles.
  * Designed novel defense strategies based on the invariable physical properties of the sensor that detect and mitigate the attack in an autonomous vehicle setting

* **Davis Cancer Research Center, Radiation Oncology, UF Health (Dec 2020 - Aug 2021)**
  * Implemented dimensionality reduction algorithms to compute the displacement fields, used to deform CT images and track organ motion.
  * Worked on the Triangulation method to track the deformed GTV surface and on a Deep texture classification model.
  * Designed LSTM-based deep learning models to predict organ-specific abdominal motion with Cine-MRI.

* **Modern Artificial Intelligence and Learning Technologies Lab, University of Florida (May 2020 - Aug 2020)**
  * Worked on a project that involved building intelligent algorithms for transportation and smart cities.
  * Implemented an algorithm that predicts the traffic patterns across intersections using real-time data received from LiDAR sensors.
  * Constructed the residual data across intersections, performed clustering, and classified them into events.

Awards and Honors
